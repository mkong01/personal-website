            Hi, my name is Michelle and I am a Management Engineering student at
            the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about project / product
            management, and leveraging new technologies to create innovative
            projects!

            During my previous coop, I was at the Economical Insurance Group as
            a project coordinator. I am very interested in gaining experience in
            the tech industry, thus I am constantly looking for ways to learn
            more about web development.

            In my spare time, I enjoy reading ðŸ“š, knitting ðŸ§¶, and discovering
            new music ðŸŽ¶.
