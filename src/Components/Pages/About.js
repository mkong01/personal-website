            Hi, my name is Michelle and I am a Management Engineering student at
            the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about project / product management,
            and leveraging new technologies to create innovative projects!
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            During my previous coop, I was at the Economical Insurance Group as
            a project coordinator. I am very interested in gaining experience in the tech industry, 
            thus I am constantly looking for ways to learn more about web & software development.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading ðŸ“š, knitting ðŸ§¶, and discovering new music ðŸŽ¶.
